bib2ref: 一个用来从bibtex文件中提取doi号并生成markdown可使用的参考文献列表的脚本

There is a need to generate a reference list form Mendeley which can be used in markdown software such as typora. However, there is no convenient tool to finish this work, and we build a python3 script to generate it. If you want to use this script, Anaconda3 is recommended for you, and selenium module is needed to install on your PC. 

```powershell
conda install selenium
```

Moreover, Chrome headless is also needed, you must install a chromedriver matching with your Chrome version. Here is a path you can download from it:

```html
